    <div class="intro">
        Rock-paper-scissors is a classic hand game played between two individuals, often used to settle disputes or make decisions in a fun and lighthearted manner.
        The game revolves around three gestures: a closed fist for rock, an open hand for paper, and an extended index and middle finger for scissors. 
        The rules are simple: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Players simultaneously choose one of the three gestures, 
        and the winner is determined by the combination of choices.
